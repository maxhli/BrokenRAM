The Broken RAM

Introduction:

For our assignment our group was tasked with sending a computer into a repair store with a faulty stick of RAM, or Random Access Memory. Shortly after recieving the project, our group gathered together and decided how we would proceed. After deciding the time, date, and course of action we determined to meet Monday on 4/14 at 3:00 PM. It was from there we put our plan into action.

Materials used:

For the project we chose to use one of our personal computers. Ultimately we used Jake's computer along with a scrap 1 gig of ram acquired from a local repair shop. However, we used did have a setback. It turned out that the first stick of RAM was a DDR2 when, in fact, we needed a DDR3, so we all decided to use break one of the existing pieces of RAM while removing the other stick. We then confirmed that the pc could function with one stick. Also we disabled the stick of RAM by removing a small piece of it, and we hit it with a hammer for good measure.
The total list of items we used are listed below:

1 Gig of RAM

1 Toshiba Satilite Laptop

1 Philips size 2 screwdriver

$60 dollars to pay the technician

Our Customer Service experience:

The repair shop we chose was SPC: Spotts Professional Computers. As we approached the technician he greeted us with and introduced himself, and then he asked us what the problem was. We described the issue as the computer runs, but the screen remains black. Then he asked if anything popped up at all? if there was any kind of loading screen? did the computer make any kind of sounds? and how many times the computer has done this. After we answered, he asked we minded showing him the problem, so we turned on the computer to recreate the problem. He then asked if this is what happened everytime, we said yes, and he offered to take a look. We then left the computer with him and left our names, address, contact information, and computer password. Approximately two and a half hours later, the technician called back and discovered the issue was indeed the RAM. Afterwards we came back paid him and picked up the PC.

Initial Take Aways:

Overall the total experience was moderately good and reliable. The technician didn't assume and only threw out one possiblity as to what the problem could be, which he originally assumed it was the motherboard. However, there were a few issues with his methods. For example, we were surprised with the diagnostic fee. The technician wasn't up front with cost until after the work was done. Another issue was that the technician took the initiative without to replace the RAM without first consulting, us, the customer, but, with that being said, he did remove the replacement part when we specified that we didn't desire the new part. Other than that the service was courteous, fast, and reliable. While the price was not mentioned from the get go, the diagnostic charge was the standard rate by his claim.

Conclusion and closing remarks:

The project as a whole was a sucess and turned out with little to no problems, and the total time consisted of 3 and a half hours, including the diagnostic and repair time. On a final note we managed to interview the technician and recieved the following basic information listed below:
